        Little Einsteins' Tutorial students participate in an interesting, preparatory curriculum, from preschool to fifht grade, with ample opportunities for individual attention and personal growth. The use of technology in the school, such as visual learning, has made Little Einsteins' Tutorial a forerunner among schools for modern learning. We encourage critical thinking, practical application, and appreciation for the arts through:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Different clubs for learning things such as French, dance, music, debate, art and crafts, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Completing the Holy Quran within Grade 5 starting from KG.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Discipline</h3>
      <p>
        The precepts of respect, responsibility, persistence and fairness are instilled in our students as part of thier education. This creates a structured, nurturing environment in which they can learn. Adoption of these same principles further prepares them to become good citizens, coworkers, and neighbours in the future.
